====================

Sugar Sync SampleTool modification for my purposes...

I wanted to extend the existing tool to troll through receivedShared folders and then paruse them for a specific folder name (added the input argument 'media' to for a folder type.  This basically still has all the same code as the example on sugarsync.com.

Installation: 
You should be able to just replace the default one with SampleTool.java from this repo and be good to go.  

Dependencies:

TODO: 
argument should be changed from 'media' to 'mediaFolder'
strip out the MagicBriefcase stuff (optional)
instead of one big method, break up the get commands a little...if possible.
